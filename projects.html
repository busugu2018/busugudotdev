                    I have hands-on experience with MuleSoft, specializing in developing and 
                    deploying integrations using Mule ESB and Anypoint Platform. My work 
                    includes building APIs based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and 
                    Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) principles, enabling seamless 
                    data flow across systems. I’ve designed and implemented API-led connectivity 
                    solutions, created RAML specifications, and developed System, Process, and 
                    Experience APIs to streamline processes and enhance operational efficiency. 
                    This experience has provided me with a solid foundation in leveraging MuleSoft 
                    to solve complex integration challenges and drive business success.

                <p>
                    I have about a year of experience working with AWS, focusing on deploying and 
                    managing cloud-based solutions. My experience includes hosting static websites 
                    using S3, configuring Route 53 for domain management and DNS routing, and setting 
                    up CloudFront distributions to improve performance and security through AWS’s 
                    global content delivery network. Additionally, I have worked with AWS Certificate 
                    Manager (ACM) to secure websites with SSL/TLS certificates and utilized CloudWatch 
                    for monitoring and performance tracking. This foundation has enabled me to build 
                    scalable, secure, and high-performing applications in the cloud.

                <h2>FrontEnd Projects:</h2>
                <p>
                    I began creating responsive websites in 2017, focusing on delivering intuitive 
                    user experiences across various devices. My frontend development experience 
                    includes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build engaging interfaces, with a 
                    strong emphasis on responsive design principles. I have worked with frameworks 
                    like Bootstrap to streamline development and ensure cross-browser compatibility. 
                    Over the years, I’ve honed my ability to transform design concepts into functional,
                    user-friendly websites that meet both aesthetic and technical requirements.

                <h2>Data Engineering Projects:</h2>
                <p>
                    I have hands-on experience with data engineering projects, leveraging tools and 
                    technologies like Hadoop, Sqoop, Hive, Ambari, and Spark to build and optimize data 
                    pipelines for large-scale data processing. My expertise in SQL allows me to efficiently 
                    query, transform, and manage data across relational databases. Additionally, I am 
                    proficient in programming with Python and Java, applying object-oriented principles (OOP) 
                    to create scalable and maintainable solutions. These skills have enabled me to design and 
                    implement robust data workflows, ensuring the seamless integration and analysis of complex 
                    datasets.
